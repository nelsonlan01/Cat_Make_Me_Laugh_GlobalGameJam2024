【Introduction】
----------------------------
- The game is about my cousin's cat behaviour, which usually MAKES ME LAUGH, and I also make the cat easily overjoyed.
- Also, this is an individual mini-project (light workload) for educational-based AI-aid game programming in front-of-class demos.

【Background Knowledge】
----------------------------
- When cats face light touch as a stimulus, their behaviour varies differently on their personality or nature.

- Some cats easily become overstimulated, and they will melt down.

【Gameplay】
----------------------------
- By clicking on your cat, you will gain some based score. You should attain as many scores as you can. Also, "laughter" is pointed out as a by-product.

- In order NOT to get your cat overstimulated, you should retain your cat's "laughter" lower than 50.

- However, "laughter" points are a randomly given number from 1 to 5.

- Luckily, "laughter" will decrease progressively as seconds pass.

【Design and Development】
----------------------------
- Put it all simply, the game is "developed" in under 3 hours, and keep it all clean and simple.

- Did not write a single line of code, to pretend students in class are not familiar with or do not have a background in coding. Only lead the students to understand the logic behind the code.

- This "game" is the demo for AI-aid programming (Prompt Engineering) and the author's future perspective usage, neither intent for actual gameplay experience nor pure, fine art in game design.
